# Advent of Code 2023 - Journey with Go

Embark on my coding adventure through the Advent of Code 2023, where I tackle intriguing puzzles with the Go language. Here's a glimpse of my journey:

- **Day 01**: Diving into Go's `embed` module.
- **Day 02**: Mapping out solutions with Go's map data structure.
- **Day 03**: Maneuvering through multidimensional arrays.
- **Day 04**: Mastering the art of parsing.
- **Day 05**: A map-centric approach, a challenge in performance optimization.
- **Day 06**: A day of straightforward computation.
- **Day 07**: Delving into Go's comparison logic and making use of the `slice` module
- **Day 08**: Navigating through data.
- **Day 09**: More computational challenges.
- **Day 11**: Transforming complex problems into simple calculations after keen observations.
- **Day 12**: Experimenting with goroutines and embracing recursion.
- **Day 13**: Traversing matrix mazes.
- **Day 14**: Tweaking matrices.
- **Day 15**: A breather with basic calculations.
- **Day 16**: Exploring graphs with breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Day 18**: Combining BFS with the Shoelace formula for area calculation.
- **Day 19**: A day of logical comparisons.
- **Day 21**: Structuring solutions with Go's structs.
- **Day 22**: Modifying a 3D space.
